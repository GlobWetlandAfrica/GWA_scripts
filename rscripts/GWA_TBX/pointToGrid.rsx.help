For every sample point that overalps with a pixel a polygon outlining the pixel boundaries will be made.", "ALG_CREATOR": "Kenneth Grogan", "ALG_DESC": "This tool takes a point vector file and makes a square outline for every point based on the grid of a specified raster.\n\nFor each point that is located within a raster pixel cell, a square ploygon is made with the polygon outline being the same extent as the raster pixel.", "Samples": "This is a vector point layer. For every point that overlaps with a pixel, a polygon will be made outling the overlapping pixel."}
